1. ABSTRACT

In this project we accomplished various image filtering tasks. First we implemented Laplace and Sobel filters. Then we identify and implement different morphological operators/filters. The third task is to compare morphological filter and median filter. Finally, we work with connected components and boundaries. The implementation of the aforementioned was done in the programming language MATLAB.

2. IMPLEMENTATION

First we implemented Laplace and Sobel filters in order to obtain more sharpened images. Then we identify the respective filters from the images and then implement different morphological operators/filters to match those applied in the sample. The third task is to compare morphological filter and median filter and see which works best in amplifying and isolating a fingerprint for comparison. Finally, we work with connected components and boundaries to accomplish tasks with an image of biological cells.
